# BinaryCounter
Extreamily Simple binary Counter for arduinos  or mostly anything.

Just hook up 4 leds w/resistors to pins 10,11,12,13 and upload the included code
The code can be easily modified for almost any microcontroller. As long as it can understand C programming language you should be good. Just don't forget to change the pin variables to match your circuit.

Every single drop of credit goes to Paul Mcwhorter and his wonderful tutorials. Without him I would be lost.
I have added the notes I took on his binary videos. Top notch stuff
Good Luck!!
